# work-day-scheduler
A daily event planner application that a user can utilize to manage their time effectively.

A user can save event text to a time block from 9am to 5pm.

The planner saves the events in local storage so that when the page is reloaded, the saved events remain.

The page features a real time clock at the top of the page which directly affects the class of the time blocks below.

Each time block block can have a dynamic class based on the real world hour; green for future, grey for past, and red, for present.
